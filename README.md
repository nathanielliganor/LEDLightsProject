## The Light of Information
This is a class project for SI 568, Introduction to Applied Data Science.

The goal is to make modular, adjustable code for controlling a strip of 300 multicolor LED lights. We were provided with the LED light strip, a microcontroller, and a power supply. We were also provided an endpoint with a basic, single "sample" command and no additional documentation. As such, we needed to develop a data structure and implement it effectively, creating our own documentation of what we learn along the way.

How it works:

We create an array of 300 LEDs with the rows representing values and columns representing individual rows.
