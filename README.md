## The Light of Information
This is a class project for SI 568, Introduction to Applied Data Science.

The goal is to make modular, adjustable code for controlling a strip of 300 multicolor LED lights. In particular, we needed to develop a data structure, document how it works and what it does, and implement it effectively. Besides an endpoint with a basic, single "sample" command, no documentation was provided.

How it works:

We create an aray of 300 LEDs with the rows representing values and columns representing individual rows.
